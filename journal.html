	<p>2/6/21 Comp Sci has been fun this year although I've had some difficulty with making my website look like I visualized it. I've started my website but I need to work on it a lot more before it's completed. I have some ideas for projects that I'm excited to work on. </p>

	<p>3/6/21 Comp sci has been going well. I've been working on a codesketch of a box of chocolates that tells you a a fortune when you click on a certain one and I think it's pretty cool so far. I want to finish my website though and make that look nice. We've been learning javascript and it's slightly confusing but I think i'll eventually get the hang of it.</p>

	<p>3/14/21 So far in CS1, we’ve learned a few things. What I feel more confident on is more basic HTML codes such as creating a div and programming that to do certain things. I learned how to use variables and the ‘get element by id’ skill to program a code for a response when clicked. I’m still slightly confused about javascript and event listeners. I think as I continue to work on my websites and code sketches I’ll learn to understand better. Github serves as a sort of homepage where all projects can be posted ‘live’. The terminal is used to navigate the actual laptop, not just sublime texts and coding projects.</p>

	<p>4/12/21 Today I coded my first array that gives you a food cuisine when you click in order to decide a meal! I was able to do this by adding an event listener of a click, and a variable of a few images and random numbers. When combining the two variables, I am able to click on the box and have it generate a random image from my selection! </p>
